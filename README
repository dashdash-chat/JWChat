JWChat - Jabber Web Chat
========================

JWChat aims to be a full featured, web based jabber client. It uses
only JavaScript and HTML on the client-side. Currently it supports
basic jabber instant messaging, roster management and muc-based
groupchats.

If you want to learn more about Jabber please refer to
http://www.jabber.org.

JWChat is a web based instant messenger (IM) just like AIM, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger or ICQ. This means you can manage your
contacts and chat with other users directly. Unlike other IMs you can
use this with your web browser without having to install any
additional software at all. For a list of supported browsers see
below. Your contact list is stored on the server. This means that you
have access to your contact list from almost any computer as long as
you've got access to the internet.

Supported browsers and plattforms
=================================

Windows XP/2000/ME/98/95:
* MS Internet Explorer version >= 5.0
* Netscape version 6 & 7
* Mozilla (stable) version >= 1.0.2
  
Mac OS X:
* Mozilla (stable) version >= 1.0.2
* Camino 0.7
* Support for safari coming soon...

Linux:
* Mozilla (stable) version >= 1.0.2


Requirements
============

You need to have access to a Jabber server with HTTP-Polling component
enabled. E.g. Ejabberd has support for HTTP-Polling built in. With
'tonneru' (http://tonneru.tanoshi.net/) you should be able to access
any Jabber server, but this is untested so far as I didn't get tonneru
working. If you succeed, please drop me a line!

Additionally you need a web-server of your choice capable
of doing address rewriting. Both must be installed on the same host.


For the Makefile to work you need perl-5.8 or newer plus some perl modules.
You can get them from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).

* Encode::compat (to support perl < v5.8.0)
* Regexp::Common
* Locale::Maketext (>=1.01)
* Locale::Maketext::Lexicon (>=0.10)
( depends Locale::Maketext::Fuzzy )

Download
========

Please refer to http://jwchat.sourceforge.net/download.shtml for
download instructions.

Quick Install Guide
===================

* Edit <jwchat-dir>/src/config.js to suit your needs.

* Do "make install" in the jwchat directory. This generates a htdocs
  directory. If you get an error please check the path to your local
  perl interpreter in scripts/templateparser.pl and make sure that the
  perl modules mentioned above are available on your system.

* Now you have to setup your web server so that it redirects requests to the URL given at HTTP_BASE of config.js to an http polling capable jabber server component.

  Here is an example from my local apache's httpd.conf:

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName zeank.darktech.org
  DocumentRoot /home/zeank/src/jwchat/htdocs
  <Directory /home/zeank/src/jwchat>
    Options  +Indexes +Multiviews
  </Directory>
  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule http://tonneru.tanoshi.net/
</VirtualHost>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

  If you don't plan to have a separated virtual host for jwchat you
  could include a .htaccess file within jwchat's htdocs/ subdirectory
  like this:

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule http-poll/ http://127.0.0.1:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</IfModule>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

  Note: You need to enable mod_rewrite and mod_proxy at your apache
  configuration. Apache2 users also need to enable the protocol
  specific proxy module mod_proxy_http.

* Restart your web server
