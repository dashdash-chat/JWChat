JWChat - Jabber Web Chat
========================

JWChat aims to be a full featured, web based jabber client. It uses
only JavaScript and HTML on the client-side. Currently it supports
basic jabber instant messaging, roster management and muc-based
groupchats.

If you want to learn more about Jabber please refer to
http://www.jabber.org.

JWChat is a web based instant messenger (IM) just like AIM, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger or ICQ. This means you can manage your
contacts and chat with other users directly. Unlike other IMs you can
use this with your web browser without having to install any
additional software at all. For a list of supported browsers see
below. Your contact list is stored on the server. This means that you
have access to your contact list from almost any computer as long as
you've got access to the internet.

Supported browsers and plattforms
=================================

Windows XP/2000/ME/98/95:
* MS Internet Explorer version >= 5.0
* Netscape version 6 & 7
* Mozilla (stable) version >= 1.0.2
  
Mac OS X:
* Mozilla (stable) version >= 1.0.2
* Camino 0.7
* Support for safari coming soon...

Linux:
* Mozilla (stable) version >= 1.0.2


Requirements
============

JWChat needs a jabberd-1.4.2 and an web-server of your choice capable
of doing address rewriting. Both must be installed on the same host.

For the Makefile to work you need perl-5.8 or newer plus some perl modules.
You can get them from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org).

* Encode::compat (to support perl <v5.8.0
* Regexp::Common
* Locale::Maketext (>=1.01)
* Locale::Maketext::Lexicon (>=0.10)
( depends Locale::Maketext::Fuzzy )

Download
========

Please refer to http://jwchat.sourceforge.net/download.shtml for
download instructions.

Quick Install Guide
===================

JWChat depends on two jabber server component which are available
separately (see download instructions for details): wcs and http.

* Compile these components by doing a "make" in both directories.

* Configure your jabber server according to the README's of both
  components.

* Restart jabber

* Edit .../jwchat/src/config.js to suit your needs.

* Do "make install" in the jwchat directory. This generates a htdocs
  directory. If you get an error please check the path to your local
  perl interpreter in scripts/templateparser.pl and make sure that the
  perl modules mentioned above are available on your system.

* Now configure your web server. Set up a VirtualHost entry that
  matches the FQDN of your jabber server. Set the DocumentRoot to the
  newly generated htdocs directory above. Set up a rewrite rule which
  redirects request from sWCS (see config.js) to sWCS2. Here is an
  example from my local apache's httpd.conf:

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<VirtualHost 192.168.99.1>
  ServerName jabber.zeank.in-berlin.de
  DocumentRoot /home/zeank/src/jwchat/htdocs
  <Directory /home/zeank/src/jwchat>
    Options  +Indexes +Multiviews
  </Directory>
  RewriteEngine on
#  RewriteLog /tmp/rw.log
#  RewriteLogLevel 1
  RewriteRule ^/wcs/(.*) http://127.0.0.1:5280/$1 [P]
</VirtualHost>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

* Restart your web server

Troubleshooting
===============

To check if your jabber server is configured correctly please open a
browser window and enter the following URL:

http://<your-hostname>:<port where the http component listens on>/login-sid.js?jid=<a registerd jid>&pass=<corresponding password>

So as an example:

http://jabber.zeank.in-berlin.de:5280/login-sid.js?jid=zeank@jabber.zeank.in-berlin.de&pass=secret

You should get an answer like this:

var jabber=new Object();jabber.sid='825d92ff0d668e7ab6aeb764c36ef5b5906ebfde@81100A8';

If not your jabber.xml is misconfigured.

Next open "http://<your hostname>" in your browser and try to log in
and look for Javascript errors.

To test your installation you can also use scripts/benchmark.pl. Have
a look at its source to understand what it does.
