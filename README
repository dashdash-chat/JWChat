JWChat - Jabber Web Chat
========================

JWChat aims to be a full featured, web based jabber client. It uses
only JavaScript and HTML on the client-side. Currently it supports
basic jabber instant messaging, roster management and muc-based
groupchats.

JWChat is a web based instant messenger (IM) just like AIM, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger or ICQ. This means you can manage your
contacts and chat with other users directly. Unlike other IMs you can
use this with your web browser without having to install any
additional software at all. For a list of supported browsers see
below. Your contact list is stored on the server. This means that you
have access to your contact list from almost any computer as long as
you've got access to the internet.
