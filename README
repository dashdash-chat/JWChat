JWChat - Jabber Web Chat
========================

JWChat aims to be a full featured, web based jabber client. It uses
only JavaScript and HTML on the client-side. Currently it supports
basic jabber instant messaging, roster management and muc-based
groupchats.

If you want to learn more about Jabber please refer to
http://www.jabber.org.

JWChat is a web based instant messenger (IM) just like AIM, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger or ICQ. This means you can manage your
contacts and chat with other users directly. Unlike other IMs you can
use this with your web browser without having to install any
additional software at all. For a list of supported browsers see
below. Your contact list is stored on the server. This means that you
have access to your contact list from almost any computer as long as
you've got access to the internet.

Requirements
============

You need to have access to a jabber server by way of either [1]HTTP Polling
or [2]HTTP Binding. Either use some server that has support for one of these
protocols biult in (e.g. [3]ejabberd) or use some gateway like [4]punjab 
(python based) or [5]JabberHTTPBind (a java servlet).

[3]http://ejabberd.jabber.ru
[4]http://punjab.sourceforge.net
[5]http://www.strigler.de/~zeank/JabberHTTPBind-0.2.4.war

Additionally you need a web-server of your choice capable
of doing address rewriting.

Download

Please refer to http://jwchat.sourceforge.net/download.shtml for
download instructions.

Quick Install Guide
===================

* Edit 'config.js' to suit your needs.

* Now you have to setup your web server so that it redirects requests
  to the URLs given at httpbase of config.js to an http polling/binding
  capable jabber server component.

  Here is an example that should work with a default ejabberd
  installation on the same host (your directory structure might
  defer):

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName localhost
  DocumentRoot /var/www/jwchat
  <Directory /var/www/jwchat>
    Options  +Indexes +Multiviews
  </Directory>
  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule http-poll/ http://127.0.0.1:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</VirtualHost>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

  If you don't plan to have a separated virtual host for jwchat you
  could include a .htaccess file within jwchat subdirectory
  like this:

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule http-poll/ http://127.0.0.1:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</IfModule>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

  Note: You need to enable mod_rewrite and mod_proxy at your apache
  configuration. Apache2 users also need to enable the protocol
  specific proxy module mod_proxy_http.

* Restart your web server
